v0.0.1: Create ctime for roach and master data
v0.1: Added interpolation functions 
v0.2: Added pointing functions and offset options in interpolation
v0.3: Added basic detectors functions
v0.3.1: Solved bug in finding the idx of the time in the roach ctime
v0.4: Added mapmaker code 
v0.4.5: Solved a bug for loading data from master with different spf than the ctime
        Solved a bug in creating ctime_master. Now, it is created with the same spf than the original fields
        Added an option to interpolate data starting from roach indices 
v0.4.6: Solved multiples bugs
        Changed the function to resample data from scipy.signal.resample to use interpolation
v1.0: Reorganization of the mapmaker and pointing libraries
      Rewrote peak finder code with more functionalities to select peaks and 
      Added separate function to convert to 100 Hz
      Change the functions to convert to equatorial or horizontal coordinates
      Added new option to input the path for creating time 
      Correct a bug in applying offset to the TOD
      Changed the algorithm to detrend the TOD
      Added multiple options to filter the data
      Added some utils functions (change sampling frequency and remove drift)
      Added options to give directly the field for master to the interpolation function in timing.py
      Moved all the pointing conversion functions to astropy
      Add options to return the offset level for a signal from the baseline
v1.1: MPI implementation of mapmaker algorithm 
      Possibility to generate single or coadded maps if multiple detectors set as input
v1.2: Added median mapmaker
      Added non iterative beam fitting
